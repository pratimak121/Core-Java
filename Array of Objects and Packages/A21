/*  Write a Java program to create a Package “SY” which has a class SYMarks 
(members – ComputerTotal, MathsTotal, and ElectronicsTotal). Create another 
package TY which has a class TYMarks (members – Theory, Practicals). Create n 
objects of Student class (having rollNumber, name, SYMarks and TYMarks). Add 
the marks of SY and TY computer subjects and calculate the Grade (‘A’ for >= 70, 
‘B’ for >= 60 ‘C’ for >= 50 , Pass Class for > =40 else ‘FAIL’) and display the result 
of the student in proper format.   */
